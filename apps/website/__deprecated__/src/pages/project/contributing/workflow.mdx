# Contribution Workflow

The project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **v14.x LTS**.

This is a monorepo maintained with [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org).

## Setting up

To install repository dependencies and bootstrap repository packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Post-installation, the packages source code is compiled.

## Compiling

The packages interdependencies, testing, the playground, and the website use the
compiled/transpiled CommonJS code of the packages, not the actual source code.

So the packages need to be compiled for the packages dependencies, testing, and
the applications to work.

```bash
npm run compile-commonjs
```

The UMD compiled code is only required when the project is to be released.

```bash
npm run compile-umd
```

## Testing

[jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest), and [@testing-library/react](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
are used for tools and components unit testing.

```bash
npm run test # test once
npm run test-watch # test with watcher
npm run test-coverage # test with coverage
```

[ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)
are used for linting.

```bash
# lint all JS/TS/MD files
npm run lint

# JavaScript/TypeScript linting
npm run lint-js # lint
npm run lint-js-fix # fix lint issues

# Markdown linting
npm run lint-md # lint
npm run lint-md-fix # fix lint issues
```

For a continuous integration environment, the installation, setup, linting, and
testing processes can be executed with:

```bash
npm run integration
```

## Git commit messages

[Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) is
used for commit message format along with the
[Conventional Changelog specification](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-conventional-changelog).

An interactive git commit message guide is already setup to ensure the convention
is followed every time there is a new commit.

## Releasing

The following conditions are required to release the project:

- Current git branch is `main`.
- Local branch is synced with remote branch.
- Git working directory is clean.
- User is located at project root path.
- Lints and tests must pass to prevent issues.

Then the release can be started:

```bash
npm run release
```

> As of writing, Lerna v3.22.1 has an issue with the commit message linter so
the process gets blocked halfway. The solution is to wait a minute until this
happens and press `Ctrl+C` to skip the linter.

It will execute the following processes:

- Bootstrap packages.
- Compile the code.
- Run linter.
- Run tests.
- Lerna publish.

Lerna will take care of publishing to NPM and releasing in GitHub.

To update the changelog after release:

```bash
npm run changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: changelog"
```
